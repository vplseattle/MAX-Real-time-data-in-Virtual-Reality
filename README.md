# MAX-VR
HTC My HTC Vive visualization project for 3D geospatial rendering of real-time flight data. 
You need a FlightAware subsciption, an HTC Vive and the Max_Worldmaking_Package
When you start it up you need to load the texture, bumpmap and worldmaps onto the globe
Then download the flightdata you need and project on the globe.
Scaling the globe allows you to fly over it...or view from within (much cooler)
Youtube here (its grainy and filmed on a potato with some awesomely cheesy music) but gives you a gist - is awesome in realtime:

There is still an issue with mapping the origin point and the textures- simple to fix- ran out of time.
